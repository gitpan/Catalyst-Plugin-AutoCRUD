2.112780-TRIAL  2011-10-06 00:43:33 Europe/London

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Full support for both composite and compound primary keys
  * Can set filters on has_many and many_to_many type relations
  * URI query string can pre-set filter(s): cpac_filter.$col=$val
  * Support for tables with no primary key (possibly read-only)
  * Support for columns with names that are not Perl identifiers

  * Support for Views (in DBIx::Class, both virtual and non-virtual)
  * DBIx::Class proxy columns are displayed and can be edited
  * Support custom accessor names on DBIx::Class columns

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Delete dialog boxes use the "friendly" row display_name
  * Tables can have multiple relations to the same table
  * Tables can have relations to themselves
  * Auto-increment columns are not displayed on the Add/Edit form
  * Default behaviour to hide "uninteresting" columns (e.g. links)
  * Default sort column is the first unhidden column

  [DEPRECATIONS]

  * The list_returns config option is no longer supported
  * No longer can edit "reverse" relations (has_one, might_have)

  [OTHER]

  * A new "backend" infrastructure has been implemented. This uses
    SQL::Translator as an abstraction between the frontend render
    engine (templates) and the storage engine (such as DBIx::Class).
    It ought to be possible to deploy AutoCRUD on top of any other
    storage engine which can provide a table/column-like interface.

  [TODO]

  * Document the new features
  * Document the backend architecture and APIs
