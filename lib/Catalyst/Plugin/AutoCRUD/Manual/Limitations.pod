Catalyst::Plugin::AutoCRUD::Manual::Limitations - Noted Limitations

=head1 Time Zone settings are lost during SELECT/UPDATE

Database fields of types such as (PostgreSQL) C<timestamp with time zone> will
be displayed with a date and time picker, but you'll lose the time zone's UTC
offset value, sorry. This could be fixed and retained through an improved UI
widget, for example.

=head1 Performance on large datasets with relations

Take care when providing access to large datasets. If the user choses to view
I<all> records (in the ExtJS2 frontend), and these records have relations,
many additional rows will be fetched from the database when AutoCRUD follows
those relations. The response of the site is likely to be severely degraded.

This is by design, as the purpose of this plugin is first and foremost to
provide administrators and developers with easy access to data sources. The
author is happy if you wish to install the plugin for end-users, but please
bear in mind the above limitation.

One possible workaround for L<DBIx::Class> storage is to create new ResultSet
classes which omit defining the relations (and even some data columns, if you
wish). Configure AutoCRUD with a Site which hides all ResultSet classes except
these, and then unecessary data will not be retrieved nor relations followed.
